# Introduction #
Uber, a ride-sharing company, is on their way to launch their new product Express POOL which offers consumers the option to decrease the cost of their ride in exchange for carpooling with other passengers and walking a short distance to a pick up location. The main issue Uber is facing is whether to make passengers wait two or five minutes to be paired with a driver. If Uber were to go with the five-minute wait time, there would be reduced costs since the algorithm would have longer time matching passengers going the same direction; however, more people would cancel their ride because of longer wait. The opposite is true for the two-minute wait time.

# Key Insight #
-A greater number of rides with a 2-minute wait are completed. The number of rides completed with a 5-minute wait are much lower.This leads us to conclude that increasing wait time from 2 to 5 minutes will decrease the total number of shared rides completed.
-Longer wait times (5-minutes) result in lower dollars on average paid to drivers per trip. From Uberâ€™s perspective, longer wait times can be beneficial to them because they are saving costs by paying their drivers less.
